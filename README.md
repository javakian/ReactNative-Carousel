I decided to make another advanced FlatList #ReactNative animation video tutorial this time. This is an animated carousel/animated slider with lots of animations going on.

In this video tutorial we'll learn how to create:

- use the snapToInterval prop
- how to display a portion from the prev and next item
- how to align the active slide in the middle
- how to use MaskedView

Built using @expo, vanilla React Native Animated API and FlatList.
This code works in plain React Native project as well since we are using only React Native APIs such as Animated and FlatList.

In this video tutorial we'll learn how to create an accordion animation in React Native using Transition API from React Native Reanimated library (https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and flexbox styling.
We will re-create an awesome and colourful animation done by InterfaceMarket.
